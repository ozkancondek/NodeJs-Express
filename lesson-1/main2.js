//package management
//npm init (to create npm modules with package.json)
//give necessary information to your project
//now i can use npm i package method because its gonna  open a dependencies part in package json automatically
//if i say npm init -y i say to everything yes
//e.i.= if i use --save-dev to package installment, its gonna added as a different dependency and only used in develepment phase

//npm i express
//we gonna try to use express without creating  template
// go to index.js file
